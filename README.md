# mars-rovers


[Live Demo](http://rovers.migeorge.me)


In this repository you will find a single page javascript app that leverages jQuery
to display data from the NASA mars rover API.

Included in the `js/config.js` is the demo API key that will work initially but has
very strict rate limits. If you'd like to lift these rate limits please get your own
API key [from here](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key)
and add it to the config file.
